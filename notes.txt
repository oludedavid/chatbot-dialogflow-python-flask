Intents are used to categorize a users intentions into separate categories.
dialogflow comes with two default intents out of the box:
a. Default welcome intent: default welcome intent is usually used to send a welcome message or introduction
b. Default Fallback Intent: when the agent is unable to match the users input to a specified intent, this intent is triggered. it provides a generic response to the unexpected query.

Training phrases: A set of phrases that may be asked by the end users of the chatbot.

Actions: An action is a task or operation associated with fulfillment or webhook functionality that can be performed when this intent is matched.

Parameters: Parameters are used to extract specific information from the users input and match it with intent. Allows 
the chatbot to gather only the important details necessary to fulfull the users request.

While actions and parameters are optional components, they play a key role in enhancing the bots performance.

The setup:

Step 1
a. Create and activate a virtual environement
i. python3 -m venv venv

b. Activate the virtual environment and install flask, python_dotenv, and openai
i. source venv/bin/activate - activates the virtual environment
ii. pip install flask python_dotenv openai

c. create a gitignore file that ignores the env environment

Step 2
/dialogflow/es/receiveMessage - This is the main route, intented to handle POST requests from Dialogflow. It receives JSON data from the request, calls the "text_completion" function with a "query_text"
and prints the result. Depending on the "result" status, it returns a JSON response with the fulfillment text.
